#### A new robotic platform
We've been working hard for the last year to provide not just some fancy hardware, but a whole robotic platform that includes hardware to build your robot, software and the tools neccesary to learn how to use it.


#### A learning platform
We believe that free exchange of ideas is critical to creating an environment where people are allowed to learn and use existing information toward creating new ideas. Thereby, this is an Open Source Initiative (OSI) with global scope bringed to educate, teach and inspire about robotics.

Erle is a fully capable computer that can run general purpose operative systems such as Windows Embedded CE, Linux kernel-based file systems (Android, Ångström, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, ArchLinux, Gentoo, ...) and well known frameworks in robotics such as the Robot Operative System (ROS).


#### Low cost drones
None of this will make sense if the price is out of bounds. We decided to put special effort in coming up with a price that is affordable to everybody.

### So, how do i get started with all this?
